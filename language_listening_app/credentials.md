For this project i am usinga free tier Google Cloud sandbox account to use necessary services. My credentials keep changing each time i login to the account. We will have to use following steps to be done before consuming a service in the code.

### Enable the Text-to-Speech API

In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to APIs & Services > Library.

### Set Up Authentication

Go to APIs & Services > Credentials.

Click "Create Credentials" and choose "Service Account."

Fill in the details, assign a role (e.g., "Project > Editor"), and click "Done."

### Generate and Download the JSON Key
