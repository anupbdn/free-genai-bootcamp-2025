## Functional Requirement

The company wants to integrate the learning portal with an AI Assistant or a language guide for the students to help practicing and improving during the learning period. There will be more than 300 students from all around teh world learning together hence even if the actual tutor isn't available to ask doubts GenAI Integration should help by giving explanations to the doubts , providing them excercise to learn and practice .

Also we need to consider the cost behind this AI development , It should be in the limit of company's affordability that is around 10-15k

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the open source LLM we chose will match our requirement and will be powerful enough for our need. We will be running the LLMs in a hardware wuth minimum investment.

## Data Strategy

We are planning to use RAG for data and hoping we dont hit any copyrigh issues . It will be all publicly available data which can be used for education purpose

## Considerations

We are considering using a truly open source model like IBM Granite , Deep Seek , Mistral . Out of these IBM Granite looks more open source because we can even trace their training data.
