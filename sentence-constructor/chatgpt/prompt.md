        |To order|	bestellen               |	Verb   |
        Sentence Structure
        (I) + (have) + (hunger), (what) + (should) + (I) + (order)?
        Clues and Consideration
        In German, instead of using "I am hungry," you need to express that you have hunger. What is the German verb for "to have"?
        "What" remains the same in most questions. Think of "What is your name?" in German.
        The verb "should" is a modal verb. Remember, modal verbs push the main verb to the end of the sentence!
        "Order" is a verb that starts with b and ends with stellen.
        Word order in German is different! Where does the verb go in a question?
        Example Sentence with Similar Words:
        "Ich habe Durst. Was soll ich trinken?" â†’ (I am thirsty. What should I drink?)
        Now, try to put it together! ðŸ˜Š
