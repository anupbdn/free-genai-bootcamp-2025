        Sentence Structure
        (I) + (have) + (hunger), (what) + (should) + (I) + (order)?
        Clues and Consideration
        In German, instead of using "I am hungry," you need to express that you have hunger. What is the German verb for "to have"?
        "What" remains the same in most questions. Think of "What is your name?" in German.
        The verb "should" is a modal verb. Remember, modal verbs push the main verb to the end of the sentence!
        "Order" is a verb that starts with b and ends with stellen.
        Word order in German is different! Where does the verb go in a question?

    Sentence Structure
    [Question word] [verb] [subject] [object] [location]?
    Clues and Considerations
    Start your sentence with the German word for "how".
    Remember, German sentence structure changes in questionsâ€”verb comes second.
    The verb "to fix" has two common options: one sounds like English, the other means "to secure."
    The German word for "pegboard" isn't commonly used; instead, "Tafel" (board) is more generic.
    The phrase "for my home office" requires a correct prepositionâ€”think about "at home" and "office" in German.
    Example clue: Wie kann ich mein Fahrrad reparieren? (How can I fix my bicycle?)
