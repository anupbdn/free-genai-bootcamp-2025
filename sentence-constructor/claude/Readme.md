Unlike other AI Assistants claude has proper prompt guidance from Anthropic. They encourage to use xml when your prompt involves multiple components like context , instructions and example. XML can be a game changer

### Issues

I don't have a paid version of claude to use project like Andrew used in the video, In this Assistant bench marking i used only prompt.md and examples.xml for the claude to reference and help us work as teaching assistant. I did spend some time and created template as in Andrew's video.
