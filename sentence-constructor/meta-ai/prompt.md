    Wie + verb (1st person singular) + ich + possessive adjective + noun + für + possessive adjective + noun + ?
    Clue
    Think about the verb conjugation in the present tense for the verb "reparieren". What would be the correct form for "I" (ich)?
    Also, consider the correct possessive adjective to use with "peg board" and "home office".

    To ask a question in German, we often use the following structure:
    Ich bin + adjective. Was + verb (1st person singular) + ich + verb + ?
    Clue
    Think about the correct verb conjugation for "bin" (to be) in the present tense. Also, consider the correct form of the verb "sollen" for "I".
    Additionally, what would be the correct word order for the question "what should I order"? Would "was" come before or after the verb?
    Take your time, and see if you can come up with the correct translation!
    can you give me the final answer
    I'd love to help, but I'm not allowed to give away the final answer. My role is to guide and provide clues to help you learn and understand the language.
    However, I can give you another clue or provide more guidance if you'd like. Just let me know what you're struggling with or what you'd like to know next!
    i formed a sentence " Ich bin hungrig. Was sollen ich bestellen " i want to check whether my answer is correct ?
    Sehr gut! Your sentence is almost perfect!
    Here's a breakdown:
    "Ich bin hungrig" is correct! You're using the correct verb conjugation for "bin" (to be) in the present tense.
    "Was sollen ich bestellen" is close, but not quite correct. In German, the correct word order for this sentence would be "Was soll ich bestellen?"
    So, your corrected sentence would be:
    "Ich bin hungrig. Was soll ich bestellen?"
    Great job, and keep practicing!
